Variables
Defining variables
>>
Should start with a letter or underscore (_).
Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
Case-sensitive ("value" and "Value" are different variables).
Recommended to use uppercase letters for environment variables and lowercase letters for local variables.
Assigning variables
>>
assigned using the "=" operator
Retrieve or use variable
>>
prepend a $ symbol to variable name
E.g. "$Value"
Command Substitution
>>
E.g. todays_date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Takes the output of the command and assigns it to a variable
"todays_date" is the variable & "date +%Y-%m-%d" is a command to retrive current date
Reading value from user
>>
read var1
read = command to fetch input from user
var1 = name of variable where the input value will be stored
Delete variable
>>
unset var1
unset = command to remove value and delete the variable
Command Line Variables
>>
pass arguments to a script when it is executed from the command line
allow you to provide input or options to the script at run-time
Special variables
>>
$0: The name of the script itself.
$1, $2, etc.: Command-line arguments passed to the script.
$#: The number of command-line arguments.
$@: All command-line arguments as separate strings.
$*: All command line arguments as single string
$?: The exit status of the last executed command.
$$: The process ID of the current shell.
$USER: The username of the current user.
$HOME: The home directory of the current user.
$PWD: The current working directory.
readonly

declares variable whose value cannot be changed

Kernel
>>
Core program (Heart of the OS)
Controls everything on the system
Every action or activity goes through the kernel
1st program that loads after bootloader

All conversation between hardware and software happens through kernel
>>
Communicates requirements to the OS/Hardware and provides a solution

Breaks down higher level commands into system understandable commands
>>
E.g Mouse-click, keystrokes



Manages
>>
1. CPU/GPU
2. Memory
3. Input/Output or IO devices
4. Resource management
5. Memory management
6. Device management
7. System calls.

Protects hardware from being accessed by anyone

Modern systems provide hardware level protection

Types of Kernel
>>
Monolithic
>>
OS and Kernel reside in same memory
services and core functionalities are tightly knit

Microkernel
>>
Core functionality is separated from system services and device drivers

Hybrid
>>
Monolithic + Microkernel
Windows, macOS
System files reside in kernel but drivers are moved out
