Bus 
>>
All stations connected through single cable called backbone cable 
Stations are connected to backbone directly or through drop cables
Sends message over the network. All machines available receive it whether it has been addressed or not
mainly used in ethernet (802.3) and 802.4 networks
simple
single point of failure

Ring
>>
Adjacent nodes can communicate
data is unidirectional
data flows in endless loop
works on token
token is passed from host to host till it reaches destination
single point of failure

Star
>>
nodes are connected to each other through central hub, switch or central computer
Central computer acts as a server and others are clients
Co-axial or RJ45 cables are used to connect

Mesh
>>
all nodes are connected to each other
multiple paths from one host to another
no central point of communication (hub, switch, central computer)
eg. Internet

Hybrid
>>
combination of different topologies
scalable
reliable
flexible

Categories of networks

LAN
>>
Local Area Network
connects small group of networks
home, hospital, college, school
easy to maintain and design
high speed
short propagation delays
low congestion

MAN
>>
Metropolitan Area Network
comparitively wider netwrok
Many organizations and telecom operators use
comparitively difficult to design
moderate speed
moderate propagation delay
higher congestion

WAN
>>
Wide Area Network
capacity to connect countries together
can be private or public
very difficult to design and maintain
low speed
high propagation delays

Modes of Addressing

IPv4 supports three different types of addressing modes. −

Unicast Addressing Mode
In this mode, data is sent only to one destined host. The Destination Address field contains 32- bit IP address of the destination host. Here the client sends data to the targeted server −

Broadcast Addressing Mode
In this mode, the packet is addressed to all the hosts in a network segment. The Destination Address field contains a special broadcast address, i.e. 255.255.255.255. When a host sees this packet on the network, it is bound to process it. Here the client sends a packet, which is entertained by all the Servers −

Multicast Addressing Mode
This mode is a mix of the previous two modes, i.e. the packet sent is neither destined to a single host nor all the hosts on the segment. In this packet, the Destination Address contains a special address which starts with 224.x.x.x and can be entertained by more than one host.


Here a server sends packets which are entertained by more than one servers. Every network has one IP address reserved for the Network Number which represents the network and one IP address reserved for the Broadcast Address, which represents all the hosts in that network.
